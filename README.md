# Test

This code automatically changes field names from snake_case (e.g., `my_variable`) to camelCase (e.g., `myVariable`) when working with data. It uses a `camelize` function for the conversion and tells Pydantic to use these new camelCase names when processing data. The `populate_by_name = True` setting ensures that Pydantic uses the field names you define in your code, not the converted ones, when filling in the model data.
